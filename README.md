# Organisational Infrastructure Risk for Small-scale IT Services & Consulting Company
**Organisational Infrastructure Risk Checklist** <br>

- Organisational Infrastructure Risk
- Operational Network Isolation 
- Large-Scale Bottleneck Of File Sanitization 
- Security Tools  
- Education
- Update And Apply Patches Of All Software And Technology <br> <br>
# Potential Threats
## Asset Management
- **Internal user :** (adds a non-compliant 
device; because a device is not in 
inventory, scans may miss it as a host 
so vulnerabilities may go undetected)

- **External adversary :** (could gain 
network access, and activities might 
not be distinguished from unmapped, 
typical traffic patterns)

- **External partner :** (may not fulfill 
responsibilities for protecting, 
detecting, or responding to incidents)


## Business Environment
- **Power failure :** (causes customers 
[e.g., emergency services, hospitals] 
with critical dependencies to 
experience an extended loss of 
internet service due to a lack of 
service level agreements and 
documented resilience requirements)

##  Awareness and Training
- **Internal user :** (may fall victim to an 
email phishing attack due to a lack of 
sufficient training)

## Data Security
- **External adversary :** (who has gained 
network access may quickly 
recognize and exfiltrate unencrypted, 
sensitive information in databases or 
within cleartext network traffic)

- **Internal user :** (may unintentionally 
send sensitive records without 
encryption, while data loss prevention 
tools might impede that error)

## Security Continuous Monitoring
- **Internal User :** (steals valuable 
equipment due to a lack of diligent 
video and log monitoring)

- **External User :** (is not quickly 
detected and thwarted due to 
ineffective monitoring)

## Response Planning
- **Supply Chain Partner** (is not able to 
provide the Security Operations 
Center with system log information 
and is unable to restore data to a 
known-good recovery point)

## Recovery Planning
- **Software failure** (could cause an 
outage in an essential business 
application that exceeds 
organizational directives regarding 
maximum tolerable downtime)

# Risk Avoidance Strategy
* Conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment
   * A risk assessment can help uncover potential gaps in your organization’s security controls and offer insight into the assets that need to be protected 
   * The security controls currently in place. Conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment can also help your organization’s IT security team identify areas of 
     vulnerability that could be potentially exploited and prioritize which vulnerabilities should be remediated first. 
   * Security ratings are a great way to gain a real-time look at cybersecurity posture of the organization and third-party vendors as well.
* Establish network access controls'
  The components are <br>
   * Restricted Access
   * Network Boundary Protection (Firewall)
* Implement firewalls and antivirus software
* Create a patch management schedule
* Continuously monitor network traffic
* Build an incident response plan
* Examine the physical security of your business
* Minimize the attack surface  
<br>

# SWOT Analysis

1. **Strengths**: 
* Effective communication among a small office with 
co-located staff
* Online email and financial applications mean no local 
servers to support and protect (third-party SaaS partners)
* Modernized office desktop equipment with current 
operating systems and connectivity
* Dedicated IRM and S&C teams on site


2. **Weaknesses**
* Few dedicated IT and information security employees
* Many endpoints are laptops that could be lost or stolen
* Office laptops do not employ full-disk encryption.

3. **Opportunities :** 
* A newly awarded contract will significantly increase 
revenue and reputation
* Expansion of services into software development and 
remote administration services will enable company 
growth
* Funds have been allocated for cybersecurity 
improvement
* Third-party partners may help quickly ramp up new 
service offerings

4. **Threats :**
* Visibility from contract announcement may cause 
adversaries to target the enterprise
* Information security requirements included in the 
terms and conditions of the new contract increase the 
criticality of cybersecurity improvement
* Additional service offerings (e.g., development and 
remote administration) increase cybersecurity risks
* Supply chain partners may bring additional security 
risks to be considered and managed
